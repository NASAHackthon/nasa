This folder(moonsurface) is all about spherical moon.

To avoid overload, I provide the link of moon's skin instead of directly upload it. The link is: 
https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/map/Moon/Clementine/UVVIS/Lunar_Clementine_UVVIS_750nm_Global_Mosaic_118m_v2

make sure to download the .tif and .xml file together, they seem to be necessary to exist at the same time.

file:
-moon surface(flat, acnes).aprx
You may open it with ArcGis Pro.

other files are automatically popped out, don't know who they are.XD
